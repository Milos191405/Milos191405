👋 Hi, I'm Milos Mirkovic

I'm a Data Analyst & Frontend Developer with a strong background in sports management, data exploration, and modern web development.
After 20+ years of experience in the sports industry — working as a coach, club manager, and team leader — I transitioned into the world of tech, where I combine analytical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving.

🔍 What I Do

Data Analysis: SQL, Power BI, Excel

Frontend Development: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS

Building dashboards, web apps, and interactive data visualizations

Turning business problems into clear, actionable insights

🎯 Why Tech?

I enjoy solving problems and building things that help people work smarter.
My experience in sports has given me organization, communication, leadership, and decision-making under pressure — skills that you don’t learn in school but are now invaluable in data and web development.
